          <p class="philo1">
            HariVote is a student-led online voting software of the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila. It allows students
            and employees to vote electronically using a website, mobile app, or any internet-connected device. HariVote
            is secure, eliminating the need for expensive and less efficient traditional voting tools and in-person
            gatherings. The system makes it easy to create and distribute electronic ballots to voters. Results are
            automatically released after the election period, saving time and money by eliminating manual tallying.
